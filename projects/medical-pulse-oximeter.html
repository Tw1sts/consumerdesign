                        <p>
                            A complete redesign of a professional-grade pulse oximeter for improved usability in high-stress medical environments. This project focused on creating a device that could be operated correctly with minimal attention, even in emergency situations.

                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>
                            MediTech's existing pulse oximeter was technically accurate but had significant usability issues that were causing problems in clinical settings:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complex menu system required too much attention</li>
                            <li>Small display was difficult to read in low-light conditions</li>
                            <li>Physical design was uncomfortable during extended use</li>
                            <li>Battery replacement was difficult with gloved hands</li>
                            <li>Alarms were frequently silenced due to confusing controls</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Research Approach</h3>
                        <p>
                            We conducted a comprehensive research program to understand the contexts and needs of medical professionals:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>24 hours of observational shadowing in ER, ICU, and general ward settings</li>
                            <li>Interviews with 18 nurses, doctors, and respiratory therapists</li>
                            <li>Contextual inquiry sessions with both experienced and new users</li>
                            <li>Competitive analysis of 8 similar devices</li>
                            <li>Error analysis from incident reports</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our research revealed several critical insights that guided the redesign:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Users rarely read device screens directly – they listen for alarms and glance at numbers from a distance</li>
                            <li>In emergency situations, fine motor control decreases significantly</li>
                            <li>Devices are often operated one-handed while the user is performing other tasks</li>
                            <li>High-contrast displays are essential in varied lighting conditions</li>
                            <li>The most common tasks should be accessible without menu navigation</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Design Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            We redesigned the MediPulse from the ground up with these key features:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Simplified Interface:</strong> Reduced the UI to show only essential information with large, high-contrast numbers</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct Controls:</strong> Dedicated physical buttons for the most common tasks, eliminating menu navigation</li>
                            <li><strong>Ergonomic Form:</strong> Asymmetric design with a textured grip that works with medical gloves</li>
                            <li><strong>Visual + Tactile Feedback:</strong> Color-coded alarms with distinctive vibration patterns for different alerts</li>
                            <li><strong>Quick-Change Battery:</strong> Redesigned battery compartment that can be opened with one hand while wearing gloves</li>
                            <li><strong>Cleanability:</strong> Sealed seams and antimicrobial coating for easy sterilization</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
                        <p>
                            We tested the design through multiple iterations:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Paper prototypes to validate the core interface concept</li>
                            <li>3D-printed form models to refine the ergonomics</li>
                            <li>Interactive prototypes tested in simulated emergency scenarios</li>
                            <li>Final validation with 30 medical professionals across three hospitals</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>
                            Each round of testing led to refinements, with particular attention to ensuring the device could be operated correctly under stress and with minimal visual attention.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>
                            The redesigned MediPulse has been enthusiastically received by medical professionals and has delivered significant improvements:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>99.8% task completion rate in user testing, up from 88% with the previous design</li>
                            <li>Training time reduced by 68%</li>
                            <li>Critical error rate decreased by 91% in simulated emergency scenarios</li>
                            <li>Product Net Promoter Score increased from 22 to 76</li>
                            <li>Won a Gold Medical Design Excellence Award in 2024</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project reinforced several important principles for medical device design:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designing for the extremes of use is critical – what works in calm conditions may fail under stress</li>
                            <li>Direct, unambiguous feedback is essential for critical devices</li>
                            <li>Physical form and digital interface must be considered as an integrated system</li>
                            <li>Testing in context reveals issues that controlled usability tests might miss</li>
                        </ul>
